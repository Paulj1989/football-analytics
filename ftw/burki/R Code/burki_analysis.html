Roman Burki has had a very up and down time as BVB goalkeeper, going fro much maligned, to the star of the show, and back again. At this point, it's a little hard to work out exactly what the view of him is among fans. But it seems as though it is net negative. 

Generally speaking, when it comes to fan judgements, I find myself on the outside looking in, 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
