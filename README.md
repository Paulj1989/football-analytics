# Football Analytics

Repository containing the code for previous football analytics visualizations and articles. This repository will occasionally be updated with small analytics projects, typically for articles written for [Fear the Wall](https://fearthewall.com). Every now and then I will work on more in-depth football analytics projects, which will be contained in their own repositories, and linked to from here.

As some of this has been done retroactively, the repository isn't exhaustive, and a lot of the code could be done with being cleaned up (something I'll pretend that I will get to one day, but that will probably never happen). Nonetheless, many of the examples should be reproducible, and more recent examples should be cleaner, better organised, and better documented.
